    <p>The word apple, whose Old English ancestor is æppel, is descended <br> from the Proto-Germanic noun *aplaz,
        descended
        in turn from Proto-Indo-European *h₂ébōl.[5]

        As late as the 17th century, the word also functioned as a generic term for all fruit, including nuts. This can
        be compared to the 14th-century Middle English expression appel of paradis, meaning a banana.[6]</p>
